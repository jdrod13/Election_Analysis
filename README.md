# Election_Analysis
Election Analysis audit for the Colorado Board of Election utilizing python.

# Python Project

## Overview of Project
    
 On this project, we collaborate with Tom, Colorado’s board of elections employee, to audit the election results. Our analysis, if focused on different voting methoods , such as mail-in Ballot, punch cards, and direct electronic recording, would determine the election’s results. In addition, the election commission requested some additional data to complete the audit. The Colorados’s board of elections asks the voter turnout for each country, the percentage of votes from each country out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.
 
 #### Election Analysis scrip Python Code
 


### Purpose
   
   
  **The purpose of this work is to report the total member of votes cast, total member of votes from candidates, the percentage of votes of each candidate the winner of the election based on popular vote. One of the main goals of this analysis is to optimize the effectiveness of the result to ultimately run all analysis with python on congresetional districts and senatorial districts, and local elections. Therefore, our job analysis is to create an effective and accurate election report.**


## Analysis 

-	How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
    
    **The was a total of 329,711 thousand votes**


-	Provide a Breakdown of the number of votes and the percent of total votes for each county in the precinct?

**Jefferson with 38,555 votes = 10.5% of the total vote.**

**Denver with 306,055 votes = 82.8% of the total vote.**

**Arapahoe with 24,801 votes = 6.7% of the total vote.**

 ### Recommendations

 
 ### Summary

-	What are the advantages of using python for future election counts results?


**This report is a detailed representation that demonstrates that using python for the analysis of products could be considered as an advantage because we can display interactive, accurate results while saving time coding our scrip instead of manually analyzing and applying formulas on excel.**


-	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original script?



**There are many pros for using python for essential processes such as analyzing the election results. One of those pros is demonstrating a reliable, fast, and practical approach to get the percentages of the vote count and total amount of votes for each candidate. This code script could be modified to show the difference in votes between the winning candidate and the last candidate. Another proactive way to alter this code is by adding more candidates from different counties and even states to calculate and demonstrate a graphical and effective representation.**
